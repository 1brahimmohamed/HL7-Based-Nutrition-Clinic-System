### Introduction

A Nutrition Clinic Management System that is developed to help nutritionists managing their daily operations.
The system is also integrated with a clinical decision support tool for lung cancer classification.
This system is developed as a part of the Healthcare Information System course at the Department of Systems & Biomedical Engineering, Cairo University.

### Overview
The system mainly consists of:
- Doctor Portal.
- Clincal desicion support module (CDSS).

### Features
